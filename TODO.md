# TODO: Improve Sudoku Auto-Detection

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Enhance detect_document_edges function: Add Hough line detection to identify grid lines and find corner intersections.
- [x] Improve contour filtering with better criteria (convexity, area ratios, etc.).
- [x] Add image preprocessing (resize, contrast adjustment) before detection.
- [x] Update auto_scan_sudoku to use the improved detection.
- [x] Switch to hybrid contour-based approach using adaptive thresholding.

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Test improved detection on sample images (sudoku.png, sudoku_2.png, etc.)
- [x] Run Streamlit app and verify auto-detection with image uploads
- [ ] Adjust parameters (Hough threshold, min line length, etc.) if detection fails
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms if auto-detection still fails
- [ ] Optimize processing speed for real-time use
